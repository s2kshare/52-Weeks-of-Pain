# 52 Weeks of Pain

Welcome to the 52 Weeks of Pain repository, where I take on the challenge of creating one project per week for an entire year! Each week, I explore a new concept, language, or technology, pushing the boundaries of my coding skills and creativity. The projects span a wide range of topics and technologies, from web development to data science, game development, and beyond.

## Goals

* Consistency
    - Build a new project every week for 52 weeks
* Learning
    - Explore a large variety of languages and technologies
* Creativity
    - Develop projects based on ideas I come up with, without limiting myself to specific domains

## Structure
Each week's project will be organized in its respective folder and will contain:

- **Project Name:** A brief description of the project idea.
- **Technology Stack:** The languages, frameworks, or libraries used.
- **Challenges & Learnings:** What I learned during the project and any challenges faced.
- **readme.md:** A read me containing an overview of the project.

## Projects
